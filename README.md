# Library Management System (Qt & C++)

## 📌 Project Overview
A Library Management System developed using **Qt Framework and C++** that allows managing books through a role-based access system.  
The application supports adding, searching, categorizing, and removing books using a **JSON-based database**.

This project was developed as a practical implementation of file handling, user roles, and search logic using modern C++ with Qt.

---

## 👥 User Roles
- **Admin**
  - Add new books
  - Search books
  - Remove books
- **User**
  - Search books only

User roles are stored in a separate JSON database.

---

## 🔍 Search Features
- Search by **Title**
- Search by **Author**
- Search by **Category**
- Supports **multiple search criteria at the same time**

---

## 🗃️ Database Design
- Books Database: `books.json`
- Users Database: `users.json`
- Data stored as an array of JSON objects

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **Qt Framework**
- **JSON File Handling**
- **Console-based Application**

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the project using **Qt Creator**
2. Build the project
3. Run the application from Qt Creator console

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Role-based access control
- JSON file handling in C++
- Modular project structure
- Search logic with multiple filters
- Qt project organization
